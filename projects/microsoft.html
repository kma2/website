          <br><br>
          After working at a financial institution the previous summer and realizing that a creative
          environment would be a better fit for me, I started learning UX and graphic design. Through a combination
          of luck and effort, I landed a design internship with Microsoft the summer of my sophomore year.
          <br><br>
          I was one of four designers in a cohort of 40 students at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage">Microsoft Garage</a>
          in Cambridge, MA. An entrepreneurial spirited internship by design, <b>each team was tasked with ideating,
          designing, developing, and testing a new product in only 12 weeks</b>. I worked on two teams, each consisting of
          6 developers. We used an agile scrum development process, which included sprint planning,
          careful feature prioritization, and constant iteration.
          <br><br><br>
          <h3>Visual Studio Team Services Slack chat bot</h3>
          We built an intelligent Slack bot that integrates with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services">Visual Studio Team Services</a>
          in order to help developer teams collaborate more efficiently and effectively. I designed the branding, landing page, signup and authentication flow, onboarding
          experience, and personality of the bot.
          <br><br>
          Additionally, I was responsible for formally demoing to key stakeholders at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, WA,
          which involved crafting a compelling story around the product and designing many slidedeck iterations. This project presented a unique opportunity to develop
          some communication design chops! Due to my NDA, I cannot discuss more specifics around this project.

          <h3>Project Santorini - Windows photos application</h3>
          Project Santorini is a photo application that evokes nostalgia and the thrill of re-discovering special moments.
          As a Universal Windows Platform application, it is compatible with mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
          <br><br>
          My role as a designer including doing a competitive analysis of the photo application landscape, creating
          storyboards and wireframes, conducting user research interviews, and working with the engineers to prioritize
          bugs and features. I had the opportunity to collaborate with another design intern in Cambridge as well as
          several Program Managers and UX Designers in Redmond, WA. My team successfully navigated Microsoft's launch
          process (which includes legal, accessibility, and other reviews), and launched a beta version of the app!
