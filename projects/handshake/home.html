                When Wellesley College replaced MyCWS (our previous career site) with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.joinhandshake.com">Handshake</a>,
                our entire student body collectively happy danced when we found out. Handshake is much more user-friendly and robust that our previous system,
                and I’m excited about the platform’s future potential. I saw some opportunities to improve Handshake’s student user experience, and wanted to
                offer some possible solutions.

          <p class="lead">
            Handshake is a college career network that aims to transform the recruiting experience for college students,
            career centers, and employers. The platform gives students access to job opportunities and career resources,
            helps career centers better serve their students, and provides employers with more efficient access to a broader
            range of talent. Handshake currently serves 3+ million students, 170+ universities, and 100,000+ employers.

          <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
          <p class="lead">
            After reading more about the company from their website and getting a better understanding of their mission,
            I jotted down some quick notes about the product and different user groups.

            Next, I spent some more time exploring all of Handshake’s main features, and did a

          <h3>Design Critique Summary</h3>
          <p class="lead">
            Learning how to use Handshake takes a little time initially, but I was glad to discover that the most important pieces
            of the puzzle <em>are</em> there — you just have to find them. As a new user, it’s easy to get lost in the navigation scheme.
            The home page would be better leveraged if it were completely personalized to the student, provided more relevant
            recommendations, and summarized everything that’s new since their last visit. Notifications would be more helpful if
            they were simplified and didn’t force a student to navigate away from their current activity.
            <br><br>
            Keeping in mind that college students are extremely busy, and that recruiting adds a significant amount of stress
            to their lives, Handshake could better serve their students by reducing complexity as much as possible.
          </p>
          <br class="large">
          <h3>User Research</h3>
          <p class="lead">
            To gain a better understanding of how students are using Handshake, I conducted a simple survey, several interviews,
            and some online research. The people I surveyed/interviewed were a mix of Wellesley College students and undergraduates
            at other schools around the country. <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/wellesley.edu/forms/d/1FCfkSOHI87XxXb1odLIj8-gg01kz67YJJAXMGweqqII/viewanalytics">You can view all 56 survey responses here</a>.
            <br><br>
            <b>Here's what I learned:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Overall, students rated Handshake 6.7/10 for intuitiveness</li>
              <li>40% of students immediately look at jobs & internships</li>
              <li>Most commonly used features: scheduling appointments with counselors (71%), browsing jobs and internships (64%), and browsing/RSVPing to events (39%)</li>
              <li>Many students struggle with navigation, often having difficulty finding the resources page and their saved jobs</li>
              <li>Students often don't understand the value of completing their profile</li>
              <li>In general, students say they’ve benefitted from Handshake, but they strongly desire a more personalized experience throughout the site</li>

                  <br><br>“I thought I applied to several internships, but later realized that I only submitted my resume through Handshake, and then needed to additionally go to the internship URL and do more application steps.”
                  <br><br>“I still have a hard time figuring some things out, like when I favorite a job post without applying to it, how do I find it again?”

              <ol>
                <li><b>Reduce complexity.</b> To reduce the cognitive load it requires to use Handshake, highlight only the most important information.</li>
                <li><b>Consistency.</b> Unify the visual identity and establish a clearer information hierarchy throughout the platform.</li>
                <li><b>Fluid Navigation.</b> Make features more discoverable and accessible. Students should easily be able to find what they’re looking for.</li>
                <li><b>Personalization.</b> Create an experience that’s completely focused on the student’s individual needs and goals.</li>

              To learn how users would respond to my designs, I conducted in-person user tests with 15 students (10 Handshake users and 5 non-Handshake users).
            </p>
            <br class="large">
            <h5>Handshake Users</h5>
            <p class="lead">I started by asking 10 students who were already Handshake users to compare the Home Page and Jobs Page of the original design and my redesign. The students I surveyed came
              from 3 different schools, represented all four class years, and had a wide variety in their areas of study. They had varying frequencies of use and familiarity with Handshake.

              <p class="left-border-text">
                <em>"Usually I get kinda overwhelmed when I check Handshake, but this looks clean and organized, and it still feels like I'm getting the same information."
                  <br><br>"I would be excited to check back for new jobs because they're personalized for me  and right there on the home page."
                  <br><br>"I like that it says whether the job is paid or unpaid - that's a really important factor for me. It's nice to see it upfront without having to go to another page, sometimes only to be disappointed to see
                  that a position is unpaid after getting excited about it from reading the job description."
                  <br><br>"Whoa I never knew you could save searches! This makes it really easy to save a search and pull it up again later."
                  <br><br>"I love the top bar. The categories are easy to understand and I can find the page I'm looking for much quicker (compared to the sidebar layout)."
                </em>

            <p class="lead">
              Comparing the two designs:
              <ul>
                <li><b>10/10</b> chose the redesign when asked: "Overall, which design do you prefer?"</li>
                <li><b>9/10</b> chose the redesign when asked: "Which design's job filtering interface feels more intuitive to you?"</li>
                <li><b>8/10</b> preferred the horizontal navigation (redesign) over the sidebar navigation (original). 1 student who chose the original admitted that their primary reason for choosing it was because they were already used to it.</li>
                <li><b>10/10</b> preferred the notifications panel (redesign) over the separate notifications page (original)</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <br class="large">
            <h5>Non-Handshake Users</h5>
            <p class="lead">
              For the following set of questions, I found 5 college students who were <em>not</em> Handshake users so that prior experience with the platform
              wouldn't influence the results.
              <br><br>
              <b>1. Testing the discoverability of "Favorite Jobs":</b> <em>"Imagine that earlier this week you saved some internships you're interested in. Start from the Home page and try to find your saved internships again."</em><br><br>
              <b>Result:</b> On average, it took <b>7 seconds</b> for students to find "Favorite Jobs" in the redesigned version, compared to <b>11 seconds</b> in the original design.
              <br><br><br>
              <b>2. Testing the discoverability of "Save Search":</b> <em>On the Jobs Page, how would you save a search?"</em><br><br>
              <b>Result:</b> On average, it took students <b>3 seconds</b> to find the "Save search" button in the redesigned version, and all 5 students were able to find it. In the original, it took 4 students an average of <b>11 seconds</b> to find, and 1 student wasn't able to find it at all by the time a whole minute had passed.
            </p>
            <br class="large">
            <h5>All Students</h5>
            <p class="lead">
              I was super excited that the feedback on my redesign was overwhelmingly positive! Overall, students found it to be more user-friendly and visually appealing than the original.
              However, even if a student had a positive reaction to the redesign, I still asked them if there was anything they didn't like or thought could be better.
              <br><br>
              A few of the Handshake users admitted that since they were already used to the original version, it might take them a little time initially to get used to the new design.
              3 students mentioned that the blue navigation bar reminded them of LinkedIn (1 student liked this, and the 2 others were neutral).
